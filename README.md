Neon Ecto Getting Started

This repository contains the application setup described in [Connect from Elixir with Ecto to Neon](https://neon.tech/docs/guides/elixir-ecto).

The application is based on the [Ecto Getting Started](https://hexdocs.pm/ecto/getting-started.html#content) guide, modified to demonstrate connecting to a Neon Serverless Postgres database. It is assumed that you have a working installation of Elixir.
